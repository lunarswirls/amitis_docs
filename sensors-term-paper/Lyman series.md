Niels Bohr produced the Bohr model theory that found electrons bound to a hydrogen atom must have quantized energy levels described by:
$E_n=-\dfrac{m_e e^4}{2(4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar)^2}\dfrac{1}{n^2}=-\dfrac{13.6eV}{n^2}$
According to Bohr's theory, when an electron falls from an initial energy level $E_i$ to a final energy level $E_f$ the atom must emit radiation with a wavelength of:
$\lambda=\dfrac{hc}{E_i-E_f}$
This can be generalized using Rydberg's formula to find:
$\dfrac{1}{\lambda}=R_H \left( 1-\dfrac{1}{n^2} \right)$ where $R_H\approx \dfrac{13.6eV}{hc}$ and $n\geq2$
The radiation spectrum of hydrogen is discrete:
