An imaging spectrometer is an instrument used in hyperspectral imaging and imaging spectroscopy to acquire a spectrally-resolved, three-dimensional image. Two axes of the image correspond to vertical and horizontal position and the third dimension contains wavelength. 

The sensor works by imaging a radiation source onto a slit by a source imager as a series of monochromatic images, the spectrum of which are then analysed over a given area. Imaging spectrometers are very good at controlling chromatic aberrations (blurring or distortion) that arise because of light being spread out over a region of space rather that focused to a point, and they have high signal-to-noise ratios.
