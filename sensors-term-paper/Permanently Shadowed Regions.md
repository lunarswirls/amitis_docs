Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) are regions on a body in the Solar System that is always in darkness, i.e. never receives direct sunlight. So far, PSRs have been observed on the [[Moon]], Mercury, and Ceres. PSRs have been indicated to contain water ice, perhaps preserving volatiles due to their stable, relatively low temperatures and reduced radiation. Although PSRs do not receive direct sunlight, they still receive radiation from other [[stars]] and scattered emissions from the Sun, as ultraviolet light is observed over $4\pi$ steradians.
