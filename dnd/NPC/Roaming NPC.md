# Roaming NPC
Non-player characters who are not bound to a location, introductions and interactions may be random.

## Saul Good
[[Party]] receives a mysterious [[Letter from the Esteemed Saul Good]]. 

## Crab Kid
[[Party]] goes to the beach and sees a kid scuttling around like a crab. Upon interaction, they pinch a random [[Party]] member with one hand and yells "RETURN TO CRAB!" 
[] If the pinched [[Party]] member begins scuttling around with them, they will start laughing and become an ally to the [[Party]]. 
[] If the pinched [[Party]] member is dismissive, the kid will stomp both feet and dozens of crabs emerge from the sand, pinching all members of the [[Party]] until the kid starts laughing and becomes an ally to the [[Party]]. 
[] If the pinched [[Party]] member is cruel, the kid will start crying and hundreds of crabs will emerge from the sand, clicking their claws in unison and the pinched [[Party]] member transforms into a crab. They retain all character skills and abilities that a crab could reasonably perform and can speak Common Tongue. The kid will only undo the curse if the player apologizes sincerely and promises to scuttle around with them if changed back to their true form.
