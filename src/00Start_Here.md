# Amitis workflow
This is supposed to be a comprehensive guide to lead new users to use Amitis. There are several things, that need to be understood before running your first simulations.

## HPC2N account and group access
One of the very first things need is the access to Kebnekaise and a project within, which has access to the executable file. For that visit [NAISS SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/) and register yourself with a federated identity. After your account has been approved, visit [this webpage](https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/tutorials/quickstart/) to learn how to log into your profile at Kebnekaise for the very first time. Furthermore ask your supervisor for the project number, so you can request access to the project and Amitis' source code.

## The basics
After this technical formality is out of the way one needs 4 files to be able to run Amitis:
1. Amitis_exe
2. [Amitis.inp](Amitis_Definitions.md)
3. [Amitis.itr](Interior_file.md)
4. [Submission file](Job_Script.md)

Take your time to read through these link to understand what each file is for and how they need to be adapted for your case. You can request example files from your supervisor, if they are not provided in this documentation.

## Running Amitis
Finally to run Amitis [read this page](Running_Amitis.md).

## Further reading
For further reading and a more technical introduction in hybrid modelling consider reading the paper published for [Amitis](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/837/1/012017) and/or visit our [website](https://amitiscode.com/).
